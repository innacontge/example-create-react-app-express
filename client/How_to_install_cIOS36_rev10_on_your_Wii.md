## How to use USB loaders
 
USB loaders are applications that allow you to run Wii games from a USB device instead of a disc. This has several advantages, such as faster loading times, less wear and tear on the disc drive, and more storage space. There are different USB loaders available, such as USB Loader GX, WiiFlow, and Configurable USB Loader. Here is a general guide on how to use them.
 
### Requirements

- A Wii console with cIOS36 rev10 installed.
- A USB device formatted to FAT32 or WBFS.
- The files of the USB loader of your choice.
- The backup files of your Wii games (in ISO or WBFS format).

### Installation

1. Copy the files of the USB loader to your SD card or USB device. Usually, you need to copy a folder to the apps directory and a folder to the root directory.
2. Copy the backup files of your Wii games to your USB device. You can use a program like WBFS Manager or Wii Backup Manager to do this.
3. Insert the SD card or USB device in your Wii.
4. Run the Homebrew Channel and launch the USB loader.

### Usage
 
The interface and options of each USB loader may vary, but generally they have similar features. You can browse your games by cover art, title, genre, etc. You can also change settings such as video mode, language, cheats, etc. To run a game, simply select it and press the A button. To return to the USB loader, press the Home button on your Wii remote.
